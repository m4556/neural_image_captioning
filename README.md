This project is demonstration of  neural network architecture with both CNNs and LSTMs to automatically generate captions from images.

### Model architecture
The core architecture used to achieve this task follows an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is a pretrained Inception, and the decoder is a basic one-layer LSTM.
